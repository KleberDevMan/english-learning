when I was a child, my family used to travel a lot.  
my father was a seller and his company obligated him to travel city to city.
We knew many places and so many different kinds of people, because of this.

I have lived near a post office, a police station, a bakery and a church.
  near a: perde de um/uma
  close to a: perto de um/uma
only last year, I lived in three different cities.
My first house was near a restaurant,
the second was near a butchery
  butchery: açougue
  butcher: açougueiro
and a third was close to a drugstore.

the best place I had to live was one house that was really close to a library.
  really: muito
  very: muito
I loved libraries when I was kid.
Since I was always traveling 
  since: já que (justificar o que disse antes) / desde que
I didn't have many people to be attached to,
  to be: ser (infinitivo)
  attached to: se conectar
so I preferred to be a friend of the books 
and the amazing characters from fictional stories.
  characters: personagens
I think that it is because of this that 
I got to be a very creative person after all.
  I got: eu consegui
  after all: afinal
