i am Ian jhonson and she is mary jhonson.

We are married and we have two children.

the first child is kavin.
He is twelve years old.
He is agitated, 
smart 
and sometimes he can be very spoiled

the second child we have is Jane.
She is quite quiet and shy. 
however she is really talkative when she gets used to you.

you guys may think we are a perfect family.
but we actually fight a lot.
my children, they argue each other very much.
It is perfecly normal anyway.
All family has its problems.
By the end of the day, we are all very happy together.
