I am going to tell about my grandfather.
He is short, balt and really funny.
He is eithty seven years old.
He is a soccer lover.
He is always with his little radio (pronunciation) listening about soccer players and everything about this world interests him.
The problem is that nothing else interests him.
He usually doesn't help my grandmother with housework.
He loves telling stories (history é a matéria) about his life.
He tell stories about when he lived in a farm with his parents and how life used to be (costuma ser) hard at that time.
My grandfather is also a fantastic old man.
Because he enjoys exercising.
He teaches gymnastics to other elder (older, só que mais respeitoso) people.
He understands about stretching (alongar) and everything.
I love him so much.
