Hard activities Of my life
This short story is about tough activities in my opinion. 
Activities we have to pass through, but they are hard and challenging. 
Although it seems easy to say that studying is nice 
and sometimes funny I can say studying is pretty much hard work.
Actually, throughout school life we are tested all time long and then we learn to
fail and to succeed. 
Studying is a hard activity to me. 
Another hard task is to talk in public. 
Through our lives we always have to talk in public is this is definitely a
challenge mainly for shy people. A third activity that I consider tough and decisive
in life is exercising! Exercise your body every day is a hard work. 
It is necessary, but it is really tiring. 
In my case, I have to do all these three activities daily. I also
have to work! I study, I work and I exercise myself. I face these three duties every
day. They are challenging, but they help us to keep a good life quality though. So
it is important to keep doing them. They are three hard goals that we have to
face, because they are fundamental
