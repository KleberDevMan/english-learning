I am going to tell about my aunt. 
My aunt is short, chubby and very proud.
She also is stubborn and very angry.
She is a hard person 
  to deal with [para lidar. deal -> lidar/acordo (Vendo por 50. Dou 45. Fechado(deal!))].
I think she has a very good heart. 
She is loyal [leal], 
  trustfull [confiável. trust -> confiar. full -> cheio] and a true friend.   
But she is really tough [difícil] to live with.
Because she is very angry.
She gets into a fight very easy with you.
Even though/even so [mesmo assim]  I love her very mutch.
I belive she is very authentic.
I like it a lot about her.
When I go at her house, she cooks delicious different pies [tortas][pronunciation] to me. 
She is wonderful [origem: wonder->imaginar; ful->cheio] cooker.
I even[até] think she should be in Master Chef program.
The problem is that she would likely[provavelmente] fight with everybody there.
