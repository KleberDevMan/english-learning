I am_going_to [futuro will/toBe_going_to] give my opinion aboult  my uncle.
My uncle is tall, funny and nice. He's mecaninc.
He works all the time with his friends at his company.
He's hardworking person.
My uncle always visits me in the summer.
We usually go_out [sair] together to travel and to visit new places.
I consider my uncle a  great friend of mine.
It is not ever relatives that eventualy becomes your real friend.
I think I can say my uncle is one exception then.
He is more like my brother than my uncle actually.
