Hey, Kevin, what do you enjoy eating for breakfast?

Kavin
I am eating my breakfast right now and 
as you can see I enjoy having eggs, bacon, a smoothy and a coffe.
  smoothy: vitamina de fruta
What about you?

Jessy
I don't enjoy eating many things,
because I am not usually hungry in the morning,
but, I often have lots of things for lunch.
I like eating vegetables (pronunciation) such as (tal como) spinach, eggplant (beringela), 
carrot (cenoura), tomato, fruits, 
meet, such as chicken meat, french fries (bata frita - fritas francesa), 
fish, rice (arroz), beans (feijão), salad and 
I also have some beverage (bebida) like juices (sucos) and so on (assim por diante).

Kavin
Gosh! You really eat a lot in lunch time even fruits!
  god = deus; gosh = nossa!; goodness = nossa! (ou bondade)
  until x even
    untill ≳ até algum lugar
    even ≳ até ≳ inclusive 

I got impressed.
I only have some salad and meat for lunch,
but I usually eat a lot at night. 
It is not being very healthy for me,
  helth: saúde
  helthy: saudável
because eating at night normally causes digestion problems. 
Even so, I normally eat a lot at night.
I usually eat greasy food.
  greasy: gordura
  fat/greasy food: comida gordurosa
Fat food is my soft spot 
  soft: suave
  soft spot: ponto fraco 
my weakness (fraqueza).

Jessy
Well, you should really change it. 
Apparently, you have a very unhealthy (pouco saudável) diet. 
I am changing my own (própria) diet lately (pronunciation. ultimamente).
I am trying do eat better everyday.
It makes our life much better.
You should try it.

Kavin
Yeah, you are right!
