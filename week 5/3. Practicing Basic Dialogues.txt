Joe: 
Hey there [ei]! What's up [e aí]? 
How are you doing today? What are you doing today?

Ash: 
Hey Joe, nothing much [nada de mais]. 
I am quite [bastante] fine, what about you? Today I am doing some exercises.
I like swimming [natação], playing soccer and some video games to relax.
Today I have some free time. 
In the morning, I want to [want + to = wanna] sleep until late and watch some cartoons,
In afternoon, I wanna exercise and 
At night I wanna meet my friends.

Joe:
Uow! That is awesome. 
Unfortunately [infelizmente], it is not my case.
My brother's uncle arrives [chegar] from his trip and 
I have to take him in the airport today in the morning.
My parents arrive from their trip too and 
I have to take them in the bus station.
So, almost [quase] my whole day is about taking people at some place.

Ash: 
Man, that sound really tiring [cansativo].
You will be exhusted by the end of the day, surely.

Joe:
Sure thing.
I will be indeed [de fato].

Sue:
Hey Phill, How is it going [como vai]? What are your plans for today? [junto: wharayour plans...]

Phill:
Hey stranger! I am really excited with these new gadgets [devise] I am receiving from
the mail today. 
It is a new computer and a new headset. 
I am posite [posirit: indica certeza de algo] 
I will be in love with them LOL [laugh out loud - rindo e voz alta == rsrs]. 
They are fairly [quite] expensive, but also considerably useful [útil]. 
Besides [além disso], I love receiving things form the mail. 
I get anxious [ansioso] and happy at the same time.

Sue:
That is some great news, man.
[eles gostam de usar muito some antes de coisas no plural. I bought some houses, I bought some controls]
I don't have anything from the mail arriving [a chegar], but I am eager [ansioso] as well [também].
My syster is having a baby today. 
She is at the hospital [pronouce].
So I believe at night we may 
[can. may é usado para posibilidades. May I help you? May I coming? May I talk to you?] see the baby.
I bet [aposto. Sporting Bet] he is cure.
I love him so much alredy.

Phill:
This is much better [melhor] than 
[than com A é o `que` de comparação. then com E é `então ou depois`] 
receiving things from the mails, LOL [rsrs],
I am sure you are thrilled [empolgada. Thrilled michael jackson. pronouce]. 
I would like so much my brother could [poderia] have a son too, 
but he doesn't want one.

Sue:
Well, maybe he changes his mind any time soon [em qualquer tempo breve].
People change very much about having a child when they get older [`old` é velho. `older` é mais velho]

Phill:
Intersting point!
I hope you are right!

Sam:
Good evening, Will! When do you come to our party tonight?

Will:
What's up, Sam? It is difficult to say right now because of where I am.
I had to travel to a neighbor city.
Our parents need to make an exam and I am helping them.
We want to go to your party, 
but you have to forgive [desculpar] us if we cannot arrive [chegar] there on time.

Sam:
Gee [abreviação de Jesus Christ ~ gee] man, no worries [preocupe].
This is my sister's party and she never finishes parties early.
You know, she is a party lover, 
but she also works at night as [como] a nurse [enfermeira].
She is a hard worker.
So, when she has an opportunity [pronunce] like this one, 
she only stops partying at sunrise [nascer do sol].

Will:
Impressive! She is old as we are and she got [tem | got é passado de get] so much energy [pronunce].
I wouldn't be able [capaz] to be awake [acordado] for such long time these days.
When I am in a party the first thing I 'look for' [procuro] is a place to sit [sentar].

Sam:
LOL [eloel], I get you [eu te entendo], man, when you arrive we can sit down and have a chat.
Just chill [fica frio].

Will:
That's great then [entao].
Thank you, Sam.

Sam:
Dont'mention it.
See you soon.
