Joe: 
Hey there [ei]! What's up [e aí]? 
How are you doing today? What are you doing today?

Ash: 
Hey Joe, nothing much [nada de mais]. 
I am quite [bastante] fine, what about you? Today I am doing some exercises.
I like swimming [natação], playing soccer and some video games to relax.
Today I have some free time. 
In the morning, I want to [want + to = wanna] sleep until late and watch some cartoons,
In afternoon, I wanna exercise and 
At night I wanna meet my friends.

Joe:
Uow! That is awesome. 
Unfortunately [infelizmente], it is not my case.
My brother's uncle arrives [chegar] from his trip and 
I have to take him in the airport today in the morning.
My parents arrive from their trip too and 
I have to take them in the bus station.
So, almost [quase] my whole day is about taking people at some place.

Ash: 
Man, that sound really tiring [cansativo].
You will be exhusted by the end of the day, surely.

Joe:
Sure thing.
I will be indeed.
